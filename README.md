# Cafe Point-of-Sale (POS) System

## Brief Description
This project aims to create a simple Point-of-Sale (POS) system for a cafe named Wake Cup. By having an automated POS system, the Wake Cup cafe can save resources and reduce the potential for human error. The POS system can be used in verifying secure customer logins, displaying the complete menu, processing order transactions, up until the printing of receipts. Lastly, the system’s added feature will display Wake Cup’s current bestseller drink based on sales data.
